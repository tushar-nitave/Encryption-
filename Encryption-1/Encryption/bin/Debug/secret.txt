Hello,

I’m Tushar Nitave pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, Sangli(Maharastra). To tell you little you about myself, I’m very fond of reading— novels, stories, books, articles, blogs etc. and share them with my friends and other people. I believe the only way to success is profound knowledge.

The idea of starting the blog struck my mind when I was thinking that, whatever knowledge I posses in whatsoever field, should share it with rest of the world so that there is accretion in its ken. This place is not only for tech-savvy but also for regular(non-technical) people. If anyone wants to contribute there work on this blog they can contact me. I would rather say you should, because there are many people out there who do great work but are not able to show to other people.

Thank You.
